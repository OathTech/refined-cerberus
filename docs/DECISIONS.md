# Decisions register

Append-only log of design rulings and their provenance. One entry
per ruling: date, [USER]/[AGENT] tag, the ruling, pointer to the
fuller record. CLAUDE.md is working practices ONLY and never logs
rulings ([USER 2026-08-29]: "CLAUDE.md isn't the right place for
logging design rulings" — the predecessor repo's CLAUDE.md became
an unreadable chronicle; this file is the fix). Full rationale for
the founding slate: `2026-08-29_rules-of-engagement.md`.

- **2026-08-29 [USER] Attachment layer**: instantiate the Iris
  program logic directly over Core; no Caesium-shaped intermediate.
  Preserves the ability to extend our reasoning.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] RefinedC is a target, not an end state**:
  steer hard at their design (coherent north star, reuse their
  design beats, no what-are-we-doing wars); extension beyond them
  only after parity.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] v1/reasoning-era designs are highly
  untrusted**: that route failed; nothing enters as design.
  Model-fidelity facts are leads only, re-verified against code.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] Proof quarry**: the cerberus-lean park
  branches carry substantial Lean proof text over Core — for
  concrete Core-wrangling obligations, search there before
  re-deriving; quarried material re-enters only where the
  RefinedC-targeted structure calls for it, re-verified in place.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] Frontend out of scope**: RefinedC's
  frontend/annotation layer is irrelevant to the core goal. Port
  target = program-logic lifting + type system + Lithium-style
  automation; specs/proofs authored in Lean natively.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] Semantics pin**: wait for
  `core/semantics-first` to land on the cerberus-lean mainline;
  pin the post-merge commit.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] Validation**: acceptance ladder = RefinedC's
  own examples/tutorial suite ("their proofs transfer"); the frozen
  15-program corpus is a secondary check once expressible, never a
  driver.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] Process**: arc/charter/orchestrator practices
  carry over; the convergence-era layered doctrine does NOT (each
  item re-earns its place). See rules-of-engagement §4–§6.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] Worktrees**: main is fine during arc-0 setup;
  thereafter arc branches in build-primed worktrees for parallel
  work.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] CLAUDE.md is working practices only**: design
  rulings live here, not there.
- **2026-08-29 [USER] THE NORTH STAR** (ratified verbatim from the
  metric/goal-collapse conversation): the product is a **Lean-native
  C verification framework** — RefinedC's architecture (ownership/
  refinement type system + Lithium-class goal-directed automation)
  rebuilt natively in Lean on iris-lean, attached directly to the
  cerberus-lean Core semantics, able to verify NEW C programs (specs
  and proofs authored in Lean, kernel-certified against the
  executable semantics, cost comparable to RefinedC's), extensible
  past their fragment toward the parent project's Linux-stack aim.
  Replay harnesses, transfer walls, and donor fidelity are
  MECHANISMS in service of this — each retired or demoted to a
  validation lane at parity, never reported as the product. (The
  house parallel: the OCaml differential oracle drove the semantics
  build and stayed a validation lane forever; replay is this port's
  OCaml oracle.) Binding instruments: (1) TWO LEDGERS — wall/replay
  metrics = the build ledger; the product ledger = a NATIVE
  VERIFICATION EXHIBIT at every arc close (a never-seen C program,
  in no donor corpus, verified end-to-end: Lean spec, our
  automation, trio cone); arc reports carry both, never conflated.
  (2) DISPOSITION-AT-INTRODUCTION — every scaffolding mechanism is
  born with a recorded disposition (dies-at-parity or
  demotes-to-validation-lane), decided at introduction; replay's
  disposition: demotes to a differential lane. (3) ENGINE-NOT-
  REPLAYER — the Lithium port is a free-running goal-solving
  engine; replay is a test harness AROUND it (feed their goal,
  compare outcomes), never a code path or mode INSIDE it. Carried
  into the Lane L charter as a design constraint.
- **2026-08-29 [AGENT] Arc-0 audit re-baseline**: the BI smoke
  lemma's axiom cone is empty (stronger than the trio bound); pinned
  as such at first build. Plant-test transcript in the arc-0 commit
  message (`a7ff8b0`).
